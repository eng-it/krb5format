krb5format
==========

A pure-Python module to parse and write the binary file formats used by the MIT
Kerberos 5 libraries.  This does not provide bindings for the krb5 libraries or
provide any support for actually using kerberos in python; it only enables
reading and writing a few of the binary file formats Kerberos uses.
